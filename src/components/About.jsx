      <p>
        I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a passion for building scalable and
        high-performance web applications. With expertise in **React, Node.js,
        Express, MongoDB, and modern web technologies**, I have successfully
        delivered multiple projects ranging from **interactive dashboards** to
        **custom solutions**.

      <p>
        I love solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and designing
        seamless user experiences. Whether it's crafting **responsive UI/UX**,
        building **RESTful APIs**, or managing **cloud deployments**, I thrive
        on turning ideas into reality.
